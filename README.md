# php-esb

Enterprise service bus (ESB) with PHP implementation.

_From wikipedia:_


> An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). 
It represents a software architecture for distributed computing, and is a special variant of the more general client-server model, wherein any application may behave as server or client. 
ESB promotes agility and flexibility with regard to high-level protocol communication between applications. 

The key features are:

- **Small:** Built on the top of tiny framework (Slim4) and 6 main classes (middlewares)
- **Simple:** Easy to understand concept and very useful
- **Fast to run:** Add your Routes between systems via built in API
- **Flexible:** A lot of features for customisation and connections
- **Short:** Connection between systems without code (mostly)
